# Quote-Guessing-Game
Quote Guessing game written in Python.

*The 'csv_scraper.py' file contains code which scrapes quotes from a website and saves them to a csv file. I used BeautifulSoup4 for scraping.

*The csv_quote_game.py' file contains the logic of the game which reads quotes from the csv file and asks the user for the guess of the author of the quote.
